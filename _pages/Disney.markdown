# My Love for Disney

#  Walt Disney: The Founder of Disney

<img src="/assets/Walt Disney.jpg" width="500px" length="500px">

 Walt Disney is the man worth recognizing in creating movies and shows that makes dreams come true! With an open heart and open mind, Walt Disney went on an adventure to inspire others to fulfill their dreams just as much as he did. He was a man with the talent to create a mouse to make everything happen and had a heart like a child. I love Disney all because of this one man. Thank you Walt Disney for letting me be a kid again!


# M.I.C.K.E.Y. M.O.U.S.E

  Who made Disney possible? Mickey Mouse! Walt Disney created this famous icon of a mouse to make the wonderful world of Disney come to life. He has a laugh like no other, a smile that make everyone happy, and a voice that children love to hear. I will always "be a part of your world" Mickey! Disney has been spreading like wildfire with amusement parks, resorts, and cruise lines. It is no wonder Walt Disney had such a fortune. Mickey Mouse is the beloved icon that made something so wonderful and fun along with music here and there! Thank you Mickey for making me smile and sing my heart out.


#  A True Disney Princess

 A true Disney princess should have a true heart for others first before herself. She should also have a dream to fulfill even if it is a challenge. I think of  myself as a true princess: a heart to fulfill my library dream (Cinderella, Tiana), being a part of a librarian's world (Ariel and Jasmine), having a prince (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty), living in a tale as old as time (Belle),  and, most important of all, there is no telling how far I go even if you had to let it go (Moana, Elsa, and Anna). If you are a true princess, then you know exactly how I feel. Be a princess!


#  My Only Trip to Disney

 The only time that I went to Disneyworld was when I was in the 8th grade. It was a choir competition and we won 2nd place out of every single choir group that went. When I stepped into Disneyworld, I was in awe! I loved every minute of it especially the rides. The one ride that I know that I would never ride again was the Haunted Mansion ride. I cried and cried and it was awful. I love going to Disney and I would love to go again.


#  Disney Vacation

There are a lot of vacation spots that Disney offers. There are cruise lines in Alaska and Florida, resorts in Hawaii, and there  different parks in Florida, France, Japan, and California. You can pick whatever place you want to go and Disney magic will be provided! If there was one Disney vacation spot that I would love to go to, it would be a Disney cruise! It would be fun and exotic. I would listen to all of the Disney music that the ship provides and it would be a dream come true! Book your vacation today and see the magic come to life.
