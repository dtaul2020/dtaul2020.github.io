# **What is the Library?**

<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/f/f5/Beauty-and-the-beast-disneyscreencaps.com-6089.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140619151632" width="500px" length="500px">

Hello my readers. This is my first blog post about libraries. Some people say that libraries are places where you check in and check out books; I believe that libraries are more than that: I believe libraries are places where history, information, and knowledge come to life.

 People from all ages can come to the library and do more than just get books; they can get audio features, magazines, encyclopedias, online materials, etc. Libraries provide programs for all ages including resume help, tutoring, English as a second language; I could go on and on but go check out for yourself: The library is filled with excellent resources filled with tons of knowledgeable information.

 That information could also be found by your most excellent researchers and teachers: your librarians. A public librarian is what I want to be when I finish school. I want to be the researcher, the teacher, a friend, and a mentor. I want to be the librarian where I can welcome my community with the resources they need. Libraries are servers to the public. When you ask yourself, "what is a library?" it is a place where people can come and be welcome with everything you can possibly want.  It is free and accessible.

 Come look for me and I will greet you with a smile and a book.



# **A Hint of Library History**

 History is everywhere. In libraries, you can find history in any resource especially online.

 The one thing that I found extremely interesting about history is the history of librarianship. Without libraries, history would not happen. The one historical person that I think of when it comes to librarianship is Former First Lady Laura Bush. You may know her as a political figure, but she was a teacher and a librarian. When she was First Lady, she wanted education to become important to everybody. As a librarian, she wanted to keep reading alive. See how history connects to libraries? That is why I love both of these together.

You know what? I love Laura Bush. She is an inspiration to me. I bet without a doubt that she is proud to have a library named after her husband: Former President George W. Bush. I wish I could thank her in person. Do you know what I would say to her if I ever met her? I would say, "Thank you for making libraries worthwhile." Who is your favorite historical figure? Is he or she deadead or alive? Is he or she an inspiration to your career? Please share with me. I will more than happy to hear about it.



# **"Extra, Extra! Read All About It"**

Have you ever heard of the phrase, "Extra, Extra! Read All About It?" That is a phrase you might hear when a newspaper article becomes important to read about. Do you know where else you can find newspapers? In the library!

The library is also like a newspaper office, only there are no reporters! Go figure! There are also newspapers found in the library catalog and in a very special area called "Special Collections" or Reference. In this area, you have to be careful when touching those types of materials. They are so old and rugged but they are legendary. So go ahead and pick up a newspaper wherever it is and let your mind soar in what our world has to bestow.

Also, if you haven't been to "Special Collections" or Reference, take a peek! But be very careful and quiet! You just might hear history calling your name. I had that happen to me. I worked in Special Collections in college. It was an amazing experience. I got to work with materials that were so incredibly drawn to historical moments. I actually heard history call my name. It was incredible. I encourage you to try it out.



# **Sing to the Reading Melody**

 There are many types of libraries out there. There are public libraries, school libraries, academic libraries, hospital libraries, law libraries, etc. Wherever you go, there is bound to be a library full of exotic materials waiting for someone to grab and take a look. Did you know that there are also music libraries? I never knew that music could have a library but as it turned out, there is!

 If you think about it, iTunes and Youtube are music libraries. They both contain many different genres and music artists that literally, it is so hard to choose! Being a music lover myself I just love to listen to the music until I am tired. So listen to the beat! The library is singing you its melody of different rhythms of research!



# **Library of Congress**

After graduation, I would love to work at the one place where history and librarianship come together as one: the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. D.C. is filled with American history. I would love to walk around the many monuments, the museums, the memorials, etc. but the one place where I want to step through is the Library of Congress.

This library was constructed in 1800, burned down in the War of 1812, and then was rebuilt using President Thomas Jefferson's library collection to be the first renewable collection to check in and check out. The architecture is still up to this very day and his collection is still there! That is remarkable! Looking inside the Library of Congress is like walking in history itself. In this library, you have everything.

For example,  in the Disney movie "National Treasure," you see Riley Poole and Ben Gates in the Library of Congress studying materials in the middle of the library. Riley shows Ben blueprints, security footage, etc. about one specific place. You can actually touch these materials! It is incredible! I would love to work there. It will be expensive to live in D.C. but it would be worth it.

It has been a dream of mine since the beginning of college to work at that library. What is your dream? Does it involve with your career? Follow your dream and do not give up. I know that I will never stop giving up!



# **Is this the End? No Let Libraries Live!**
 I know that technology is becoming broad but for libraries, I just love picking up a book manually, turning a page with my hand. Now I hear that you can turn a page just by a touch of your finger?! Sorry for being blunt but that is still weird to me! Plus, you have to pay money in order for you to keep that book in your Kindle or some other e-book collection.

 The library's materials are free not paid unless you want to pay the overdue fees! Let libraries live for their purpose: to manually read resources with just your hand turning the page and getting books that are on the shelf not from an online site. I understand if that is the only way to go if manual labor (meaning your hands) does not work. So I ask you: which side do you choose for the library to continue? Manually or technology? Like Tom Cruise said "With me or without me?" It is your choice!
